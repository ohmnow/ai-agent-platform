## 📊 Test Results Summary

### ✅ **PASSING (9/10 components)**

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Landing Page | ✅ PASS | Loads correctly, 3 template cards, input field working |
| Dashboard UI | ✅ PASS | Chat interface loads, 3 agent indicators, send button functional |
| Web Server | ✅ PASS | Running on port 3000, all endpoints responding |
| Master Orchestrator | ✅ PASS | Receiving queries, creating sessions |
| Agent Delegation | ✅ PASS | Tools being invoked correctly |
| Database Integration | ✅ PASS | Prisma queries executing (see server logs) |
| MCP Server | ✅ PASS | `mcp__user-data__analyze_transactions` firing |
| Permission System | ✅ PASS | Auto-approving MCP tools as configured |
| Autonomous PR Workflow | ✅ PASS | Successfully merged PRs #3 & #4 with implementations |

### ⚠️ **NEEDS FIX (1/10 components)**

| Component | Status | Issue | Impact |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| Frontend Streaming | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Agent responses not displaying in chat UI | Users see "🤔 Thinking..." indefinitely |

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Backend logs show: `✅ Tool completed: mcp__user-data__analyze_transactions`
- Frontend shows: "🤔 Thinking..." (never updates)
- **Issue:** Response streaming from backend to frontend is broken
- **Likely cause:** SSE (Server-Sent Events) not properly emitting final responses

**Fix Required:** Check `src/web/api/agents.ts` line ~116 where results are returned to ensure proper SSE format.

## 🐛 Known Issues & Fixes

### Issue #1: Frontend Streaming Display ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Problem:** Agent responses execute but don't display in chat UI

**Evidence:**
- Server logs: `✅ Tool completed: mcp__user-data__analyze_transactions`
- Browser UI: "🤔 Thinking..." (never updates)

**Root Cause:** SSE response stream not properly formatted or frontend not parsing

**Fix:**
```typescript
// In src/web/api/agents.ts
// Ensure final result is sent as SSE event:
res.write(`data: ${JSON.stringify({ type: 'result', result: finalText })}\n\n`);
res.write('data: [DONE]\n\n');
res.end();
```

**Test After Fix:**
1. Query: "Show me my October spending"
2. Expected: Table with spending by category
3. Actual (current): "🤔 Thinking..." indefinitely

### Issue #2: Merge Conflicts in Feature PRs ⚠️ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Problem:** PRs #6, #7, #9, #10 have merge conflicts

**Files Affected:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Multiple PRs adding different models
- `src/agents/master-orchestrator.ts` - Multiple agent imports

**Fix:** Sequential merge with conflict resolution or consolidated PR

---

## 🎯 Remaining Work to 100% Complete

### Critical Path (Must Fix)
1. **Fix frontend streaming display** (1-2 hours)
   - Debug SSE event format in `src/web/api/agents.ts`
   - Ensure `app.js` properly handles all event types
   - Test end-to-end query flow

2. **Resolve PR merge conflicts** (2-3 hours)
   - Merge PR #6 (Investing) with schema conflict resolution
   - Merge PR #7 (Email)
   - Merge PR #9 (Task/Calendar)
   - Merge PR #10 (Prisma Schema Foundation)

### Nice to Have (Polish)
3. **Error handling UI** (1 hour)
   - Show actual error messages instead of "🤔 Thinking..."
   - Add timeout detection
   - Add retry button

4. **Session persistence** (1 hour)
   - Store session history in database
   - Allow users to resume conversations

5. **Agent status indicators** (30 min)
   - Show which agent is currently active
   - Display real-time tool usage
