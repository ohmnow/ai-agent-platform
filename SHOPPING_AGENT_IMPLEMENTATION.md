├── prices/[product-name]-price-history.md
├── deals/[category]-deals-YYYY-MM-DD.md
├── wishlist.md

```

- `WebSearch`: Web searching capabilities
- `WebFetch`: Content fetching from websites

- `Task`: Subagent delegation

## Usage
The shopping agent is automatically triggered by the master orchestrator when users mention:
