# High-Level App Description

## Product Name

Agentcomm

## Concept

A **multi-agent productivity platform** where users interact with specialized AI agents through a unified interface. Each agent operates independently with focused context, managing specific domains of the user's life (e.g., investing, finance, research). The system features a **command center dashboard** that provides real-time visibility into all active agent tasks, scheduled operations, and results.
