# Agentcomm Product Roadmap

## Product Vision Analysis

**Goal:** Multi-agent productivity platform with command center dashboard for specialized AI agents

**Current State:**
- âœ… Basic agent orchestration working
- âœ… SSE streaming implemented
- âœ… Permission system functional
- âœ… Database-backed tools (sub-10ms)
- âœ… MCP server integration
- âœ… Claude Code automation for PR development

**Gap:** Need to build command center UI, scheduling, integrations, and user management

---

## Strategic Prioritization Framework

### P0 (Core Infrastructure) - **Build Now**
Critical foundation that everything depends on. Block all other work.

### P1 (Integration Points) - **Build Architecture, Stub Implementation**
Key integration points we control. Build interfaces now, let Claude Code implement via PRs.

### P2 (Feature Development) - **Delegate to Claude Code PRs**
Features that can be built independently once infrastructure exists.

### P3 (Nice-to-Have) - **Future Iterations**
Enhancement features for post-MVP.

## Recommended Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (This Week)
**We build manually:**
1. Complete database schema (users, workspaces, tasks, conversations)
2. Implement authentication system
3. Build core API layer
4. Set up dashboard foundation

**Output:** Solid foundation for all features

### Phase 2: Integration Points (Week 2)
**We build interfaces, Claude Code implements:**
1. Dashboard component stubs â†’ PR for Claude
2. Scheduler architecture â†’ PR for Claude
3. Integration interfaces â†’ PR for Claude
4. Workspace system â†’ PR for Claude

**Output:** All integration points defined, Claude filling in implementation

### Phase 3: Feature Development (Week 2-3)
**Claude Code builds via PRs:**
1. Complete Budget Analyzer (PR #3)
2. Complete Pattern Detection (PR #4)
3. Investing Agent (new PR)
4. Enhanced Finance Agent (new PR)
5. Onboarding flow (new PR)

**Output:** Feature-complete MVP

### Phase 4: Polish & Testing (Week 3-4)
1. Integration testing
2. End-to-end testing
3. Performance optimization
4. UI/UX polish

## Resource Allocation Strategy

### You (Manual Work)
- Database schema design
- Authentication setup
- Core API architecture
- Integration point definitions
- PR review and merging

### Claude Code (Automated PRs)
- Feature implementation
- Test coverage
- Component styling
- Algorithm implementation
- Documentation

### Benefits of This Approach
1. **Speed:** Parallel development (you + Claude Code)
2. **Quality:** You control architecture, Claude handles implementation
3. **Focus:** You work on high-leverage decisions
4. **Scale:** Claude can work on multiple PRs simultaneously
5. **Learning:** Claude's implementations become codebase patterns

## Decision Points

### Immediate Decisions Needed
1. **Auth System:** Clerk vs Auth0 vs Custom?
2. **Frontend Framework:** Next.js vs React + Express?
3. **Dashboard Library:** Recharts vs Chart.js vs D3?
4. **Deployment:** Vercel vs Railway vs AWS?
5. **Database:** Keep SQLite or migrate to Postgres?

### Can Defer
- Mobile app platform
- Agent marketplace design
- Collaboration features
- Payment/pricing model

---

## Next Actions

### Recommended Next Steps (in order):
1. **Review this roadmap** - Align on priorities
2. **Make technology decisions** - Auth, frontend, deployment
3. **Create P0 PRs** - Database schema, auth setup
4. **Build core API** - Manual implementation
5. **Create P1 stub PRs** - Let Claude Code implement
6. **Monitor Claude's work** - Review and merge PRs
7. **Integrate and test** - Bring it all together

### First PR to Create Manually:
**"Core Database Schema & User Management"**
- Complete Prisma schema
- User model with preferences
- Agent workspace model
- Task/schedule model
- Conversation history model

This unblocks everything else.

## Questions for Alignment

1. Timeline expectations? (Realistic: 3-4 weeks for solid MVP)
2. MVP scope? (Minimal = Finance + Dashboard, Full = All agents)
3. Solo project or planning to add devs?
4. Deployment preference? (Vercel simplest for Next.js)
5. Auth preference? (Clerk easiest, most features out-of-box)
